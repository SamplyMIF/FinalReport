\label{ch:realisation}

This will give a description of how the design was implemented and a description of the testing of the implementation. The following is expected: \\
• Description of how the design was implemented for each stage and each
component of the system. \\
• Description of problems encountered during implementation and the solutions to these problems.\\
• Changes made to the design in the course of implementation and the
justification. *** \\
• Description of various testing of the implementation of each stage and each component of the system including test cases used, expected results, and actual results. \\
• Snapshot of code listing of key methods and a small number of screen shots may be included. However, typically, full code listings, detail screen shots, and test runs will appear as appendices.\\
Again, keep in mind that examiners might not look at all the details of the material included in the appendices. So, make sure that the really important points of the implementation and testing are explained here.\\
*** Typically, there are two cases of modifications as compared with the design stage:\\
1. If the design has been revised since the design stage and the implementation now follows this revised design, the DESIGN section should present the revised design together with comments explaining and justifying the changes.\\
2. If the design has not been revised since the design stage, but the
implementation differs to a lesser or greater extent from that design, the
DESIGN section would be pretty much identical to the original design 
documentation but the REALISATION section would explain the differences
between design and implementation. \\
